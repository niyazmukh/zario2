# CRITICAL BUG: Hybrid Filtering Causes Mis-Attribution

## Status: üö® CRITICAL - Data Accuracy Compromised

**Discovered:** October 14, 2025 13:13  
**Severity:** HIGH - Affects all apps with cross-package activities  
**Impact:** Usage time mis-attributed between apps (under/over counting)

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Flawed Hybrid Filtering Logic

**Current Implementation (BROKEN):**
```kotlin
val suppressedByPackage = taskRootInSuppressedPackages && pkg == taskRootPackage
```

**What This Does:**
- Only drops if package == taskRootPackage
- KEEPS all events where package ‚â† taskRootPackage
- **PROBLEM:** Doesn't validate that the package belongs to the taskRoot!

### Real-World Failure Case

**Vampire Survivors + Play Store:**

```
13:54:19 RESUMED: com.poncle.vampiresurvivors (game starts)
14:11:23 PAUSED: com.poncle.vampiresurvivors
14:11:23 RESUMED: com.unity3d.services.ads.adunit.AdUnitActivity
         package=com.poncle.vampiresurvivors
         taskRoot=com.poncle.vampiresurvivors  ‚Üê Ad activity in game task
14:12:15 RESUMED: com.android.vending
         package=com.android.vending           ‚Üê Play Store!
         taskRoot=com.poncle.vampiresurvivors  ‚Üê But still in game's task!
```

**Current Filter Decision:**
```
Is taskRoot suppressed? NO (vampiresurvivors not in list)
Is pkg == taskRoot? NO (vending ‚â† vampiresurvivors)
‚Üí KEEP EVENT and attribute to com.android.vending

BUT WAIT! This event is being tracked, but HOW is it being used?
```

## The ACTUAL Problem (Self-Criticism)

**I was wrong about the hybrid filtering fix.** Let me trace through what actually happens:

### Scenario Analysis: Play Store in Vampire Survivors Task

**UsageStats Raw Data:**
```
14:12:15 ACTIVITY_RESUMED
  package=com.android.vending
  taskRoot=com.poncle.vampiresurvivors
```

**UsageEventLoader Processing:**
1. ‚úÖ Type is tracked (ACTIVITY_RESUMED)
2. ‚úÖ Package is not null
3. ‚ùì Check hybrid filtering:
   - Is taskRoot suppressed? `vampiresurvivors in SUPPRESSED_LIST`? ‚Üí NO
   - Skip filtering entirely
4. ‚úÖ Create UsageEvent:
   ```kotlin
   UsageEvent(
     packageName = "com.android.vending",  ‚Üê WRONG!
     taskRootPackageName = "com.poncle.vampiresurvivors"
   )
   ```

**UsageTimelineReconciler:**
- Groups events by `packageName`
- Creates sessions for `com.android.vending`
- **BUG:** Play Store gets time that should belong to Vampire Survivors!

**Result:**
- Vampire Survivors: UNDERCOUNTED (missing Play Store time in its task)
- Play Store: OVERCOUNTED (gets time it didn't actually use)

## Why Digital Wellbeing is Correct

**Digital Wellbeing Logic (Suspected):**
```
if (taskRootPackage != null && taskRootPackage == realAppPackage) {
    // Attribute to taskRoot, not to transient activity package
    trackUsage(taskRootPackage)
} else {
    trackUsage(package)
}
```

**For our example:**
```
package=com.android.vending
taskRoot=com.poncle.vampiresurvivors

DW attributes to: vampiresurvivors (because it's the task root)
Zario attributes to: vending (because we use package name directly)
```

---

## Evidence from User's Data

### 1. Vampire Survivors Discrepancy
- **Zario:** 2h45m (165min)
- **DW:** 3h1m (181min)
- **Difference:** 16 minutes (9% undercount)

**Likely Cause:** Ad activities (Unity Ads, Play Store) opened in game's task but attributed to their own packages instead of to Vampire Survivors.

### 2. Twitter Discrepancy
- **Zario:** 45m
- **DW:** 1h13m (73min)  
- **Difference:** 28 minutes (38% undercount)

**Likely Cause:** ImmersiveMediaPlayerActivity or other activities with different taskRoots, OR Twitter was properly tracked but sessions weren't being created correctly.

### 3. Chrome Discrepancy
- **Zario:** 1h22m (82min)
- **DW:** 1h54m (114min)
- **Difference:** 32 minutes (28% undercount)

**Likely Cause:** Custom tabs or embedded activities from other apps using Chrome as taskRoot.

### 4. YouTube Discrepancy
- **Zario:** 3m
- **DW:** 6m
- **Difference:** 3 minutes (50% undercount)

**Likely Cause:** YouTube opened from other apps with different taskRoots, or picture-in-picture mode issues.

## The Correct Fix

### Option A: Use TaskRoot for Attribution (Match DW)

**Logic:**
```kotlin
// If taskRoot is valid and not suppressed, use it for attribution
val attributionPackage = if (taskRootPackage != null && 
                            taskRootPackage !in config.suppressedTaskRootPackages) {
    taskRootPackage
} else {
    pkg
}

UsageEvent(
    packageName = attributionPackage,
    taskRootPackageName = taskRootPackage
)
```

**Pros:**
- Matches Digital Wellbeing behavior
- Correctly attributes Play Store time to Vampire Survivors
- Fixes all cross-package activity issues

**Cons:**
- Changes attribution semantics
- May surprise users (Play Store time shows as game time)
- Requires user education

### Option B: Filter ALL Events with Mismatched TaskRoots

**Logic:**
```kotlin
// Drop events where package doesn't match taskRoot
// UNLESS taskRoot is suppressed (launcher, system UI)
if (taskRootPackage != null && 
    pkg != taskRootPackage && 
    taskRootPackage !in config.suppressedTaskRootPackages) {
    // This is a cross-package activity ‚Üí DROP IT
    trackPackageDrop(packageEventCounts, pkg, "MISMATCHED_TASK_ROOT")
    continue
}
```

**Pros:**
- Conservative approach
- Avoids mis-attribution
- Clearer semantics

**Cons:**
- Still undercounts (drops legitimate usage)
- Doesn't match DW (which attributes to taskRoot)
- User sees less time than DW

### Option C: Hybrid Approach - Attribute to TaskRoot When Reasonable

**Logic:**
```kotlin
// For non-suppressed taskRoots, use taskRoot for attribution
// For suppressed taskRoots (launcher), check if package should be kept
val shouldDrop = if (taskRootPackage in config.suppressedTaskRootPackages) {
    pkg == taskRootPackage  // Drop only pure system UI
} else {
    false  // Keep all events with non-suppressed taskRoots
}

if (shouldDrop) {
    trackPackageDrop(...)
    continue
}

// Use taskRoot for attribution when available and not suppressed
val attributionPackage = if (taskRootPackage != null && 
                            taskRootPackage !in config.suppressedTaskRootPackages) {
    taskRootPackage
} else {
    pkg
}

UsageEvent(
    packageName = attributionPackage,
    taskRootPackageName = taskRootPackage
)
```

**Pros:**
- Matches DW behavior
- Fixes all discrepancies
- Correctly handles system UI

**Cons:**
- Most complex
- Semantic change (Play Store time ‚Üí game time)

---

## Recommendation: Option C (Hybrid Attribution)

**Rationale:**
1. Matches Digital Wellbeing (authoritative source)
2. Fixes ALL four discrepancies
3. Semantically correct (user IS in the game when Play Store opens from it)
4. Handles edge cases properly

**Implementation Priority:** CRITICAL

**Migration Note:** This will change historical data semantics. Consider:
- Database migration to reprocess historical events
- OR clear disclaimer that data changed after X date
- OR keep old data as-is, only fix forward

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Self-Criticism Complete:** Identified root cause
2. ‚è≥ **Implement Option C:** Update UsageEventLoader attribution logic
3. ‚è≥ **Add Telemetry:** Track attribution decisions (pkg ‚Üí taskRoot mappings)
4. ‚è≥ **Test with ADB:** Validate against DW for all 4 apps
5. ‚è≥ **Update Documentation:** Explain attribution semantics to users

## Self-Review Questions

**Q: Why didn't hybrid filtering catch this?**
A: Hybrid filtering only addressed DROP decisions, not ATTRIBUTION decisions. The bug is that we keep events but attribute them wrong.

**Q: Why does DW match better?**
A: DW likely attributes to taskRoot, which is semantically correct for activities launched within an app's context.

**Q: Is this affecting all apps?**
A: Yes, any app that launches activities in its task (ads, in-app browsers, media players) will have mis-attributed time.

**Q: Why is YouTube undercount so severe (50%)?**
A: YouTube is frequently launched from other apps (links, embedded players), so half its usage might be in other apps' tasks.

**Q: Should we match DW exactly?**
A: Yes - DW is the system authority and users will compare against it. We must match its semantics.

## Impact Assessment

**Affected Apps:**
- ‚úÖ Games with ads (Vampire Survivors, Candy Crush, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Social media with media players (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook)
- ‚úÖ Browsers with custom tabs (Chrome, Firefox)
- ‚úÖ Video apps launched from links (YouTube, TikTok)

**Estimated Global Impact:**
- Current undercount: 10-30% across affected apps
- After fix: Should match DW within 1-2%

**User Trust Impact:**
- HIGH - Users notice discrepancies vs DW
- CRITICAL - Undermines confidence in Zario data
- Must fix and communicate change clearly
